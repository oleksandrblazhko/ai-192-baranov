| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Denial of Service | An adversary can perform action on behalf of other user due to lack of controls against cross domain requests | Failure to restrict requests originating from third party domains may result in unauthorized actions or access of data |
| 2 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content |
| 3 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers | An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers |
| 4 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic to Web Application | An adversary may conduct man in the middle attack and downgrade TLS connection to clear text protocol, or forcing browser communication to pass through a proxy server that he controls. This may happen because the application may use mixed content or HTTP Strict Transport Security policy is not ensured. |
| 5 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from uncleared browser cache | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from uncleared browser cache |
| 6 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Repudiation | Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system |
| 7 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Spoofing | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to improper logout and timeout | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user. |
| 8 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Spoofing | An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration | Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values |
| 9 | Web-App-Database-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure Postgres DB instances due to weak network security configuration | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to  Azure Database for PostgreSQL instances due to weak network security configuration. |
| 10 | Web-App-Database-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain long term, persistent access to an Azure Postgres DB instance through the compromise of local user account password(s) | An adversary can gain long term, persistent access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance through the compromise of local user account password(s). |
| 11 | Web-App-Database-Response | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content |
| 12 | Web-App-Database-Response | Spoofing | An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials | Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor. |
| 13 | Web-App-Database-Response | Spoofing | An adversary may spoof Azure Database for PostgreSQL and gain access to Web Application | If proper authentication is not in place, an adversary can spoof a source process or external entity and gain unauthorized access to the Web Application |
| 14 | Web-App-Database-Response | Tampering | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data stored in Web App's config files | An adversary can gain access to the config files. and if sensitive data is stored in it, it would be compromised. |
| 15 | Browser-Web-App-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to resources in an Azure subscription | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to resources in Azure subscription. The adversary can be either a disgruntled internal user, or someone who has stolen the credentials of an Azure subscription. |
| 16 | Browser-Web-App-Response | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to resources in an Azure subscription | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to resources in Azure subscription. The adversary can be either a disgruntled internal user, or someone who has stolen the credentials of an Azure subscription. |
| 17 | Browser-Web-App-Response | Spoofing | An adversary may spoof an Azure administrator and gain access to Azure subscription portal | An adversary may spoof an Azure administrator and gain access to Azure subscription portal if the administrator's credentials are compromised. |
